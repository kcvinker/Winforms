// Documentation for NumberPicker type
/*
NumberPicker is known as Updown control in win32 sector and in .Net sector, it is known as NumericUpDown.
Since, it is using for picking numbers only, I have decided to give this name.
It is basically a combo of two controls.
    1. Spin control - Which has two small buttons on it and those buttons have a up & down arrow symbol.
    2. Edit control - Which is associated with the spin control.
You can either click the spin buttons or type directly to the textbox or you can press the up & down arrow keys.
Note :- If you type some numbers in text area, you need to press Enter or Tab key to make that
change updated in NumberPicker. A mouse click on the spin button also cause the updation.
Otherwise, you lost the entered input and control will display the last updated value.
Defaults
    min_range = 0
    max_range = 100
    step = 1
    decimal precision = 0

/*NumericUpdown in .NET has an interesting bug.
When you set the MouseLeave event, if you move the mouse pointer towards the spin button area,
You will get a mouse leave event. Which I am sure anyone wants to get.
Reason for this problem is obvious. NumericUpdown is a combo of two controls.
So the mouse leave event will be triggered when pointer reaches the edge of textbox or spin button.
So the event will be fired. But this is not a big issue. We can solve it easily.
I don't know why MS is leaving this bug as it is.
In this NumberPicker, I solved this issue and the onMouseLeave event will be fired only when you move the
pointer out of it's actual rect. So each time when your NumberPicker get a WM_MOUSELEAVE message,
it will check the current mouse position. Then it will check if that position is it's buddy control.
If that mouse points are inside it's buddy's rect, the message will be suppressed. Otherwise, it will fire a
onMouseLeave event.
